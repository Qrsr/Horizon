# Background of this "Wiki"
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/f04horizon_gamepedia_en/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png" height="130" align="left">

> _This Wiki presence is nothing more than a kind of compendium of ideas and vision of a more complex fallout. My way of saying thank you. Of course, i would really like to see all of these integrated into Horizon. It's not easy to describe something that doesn't exist in a way that everyone can understand. So don't hold it against me if every now and then whole nice grits are written. . `Thanks to everyone who took on the bombing of ideas and possibly even made them a reality.`_

💠 `Special THANKS to Zawinul` for the publicly accessible experience: _Horizon_! A work of art. made up for the whole ruined Fallout 4 experience for me! 💠

I can't say enough this mod combines a lot of these and doesn't disappoint. It is art at the highest level. _Support the mod and it will grow and become something really big that will affect many._ The real art of programming and designing a game is not to look beautiful, pictures that hang on the wall can do that much better, but to create an experience, a world that, although it is surreal, pulls you under its spell to such an extent that you forget everything else. If a game or a mod appears inauthentic from the start, the whole magic is quickly over. `it is true art when the player is put into a trance, a kind of hypnotic state in which he sinks and feels good and forgets everything around him. everything that breaks this state is failure on the part of whoever publishes the game.`

> I love Fallout, although the best parts were still Fallout 1 and 2. Tactics was also very nice, but the great in-depth dialogue options were missing, but it was a great experience to learn more from the BoS's point of view. With the takeover, the right from Fallout to Bethesda, I had a corresponding expectation that unfortunately was not fulfilled. In my opinion, the representation and processing of the rights has absolutely gone wrong. Don't get me wrong, Bethesda can design very beautiful worlds, but profound dialogues cannot be reached. there is a lack of details in the right places. if the dialog options don't give it then it should be achieved via gameplay mechanics, in my opinion that was not achieved either. It still remains a nice game, although the options of the so-called fallout world in the 3d sector could be represented much more extensively. the ones who did it very well were those from Obsidian (Fallout: New Vegas).

`❗ PLEASE NOTE: everything that is written here is a possibility. they are not facts, they are my views. I love challenges and a very difficult game in which you are constantly challenged and never rest. so, i'm talking explicitly about survival and desolation mode, not the classic game mode. I am neither omniscient nor infallible. all is to be regarded as inspiration, again not as fact. popcorn and cola are definitely advisable.`

# General Impulse

### My Setup
> So that everyone knows on which basis the arguments are made ... Horizon with some minor not game breaking mods. Mostly stuff which reduces load time and enhances performance.
* Horizon 1.8 Beta 7
* **Mods:** some of Greb's Horizon Essential Mods: https://nemal34.github.io/grebHorizonEssential/
* **Difficulty:** Survivor (1.5:1)
* **Game Mode:** Survival and Desolation Mode (Hardcore)
* Timescale (Half)
* Strict Carry Weight
* Settlements Enhanced

**In addition, lately I've been playing more and more as follows:** without any armor (absolutely senseless mechanics), without power armor, without skills and perks that can be unlocked via the skill menu, without V.A.N.S. and other magic. Just to see what is possible and how the game behaves.

***

### Skill Progression
In my opinion everything really everything that the player receives makes NPCs more and more meaningless. NPCs have handicaps from the beginning and the biggest handicap is that the player only enjoys advantages. Almost every skill and perk should be actively increased by the so-called "skill gain mechanics". Skills can only be increased in this way and not by exchanging experience points.

Combat skills make any attempt to balance the game useless. Sneak is all you need. If the NPC doesn't see you, he can't hit you either, he doesn't even aim at you. This means that every AI script is obsolete. There is no enemy who can track you down if you camouflage yourself accordingly. No robot that detects your thermal image, no mole rat that detects your noise. No NPC was injected with a script which one would call intelligent.

Because that's not enough if the NPCs don't notice you, you just have to eliminate them. best from a great distance. So choose a firearm with a long range and a lot of penetration. this works with exactly 0 points in sniper skill. funny isn't it?

***

### Damage
harm should be absolute. if there is no protection, the damage is 100%. side effects (health) depend on the anatomy of the projectile. you could also limit the health of each enemy to 100 and the damage of each projectile to 100. now what exactly ensures that the damage is minimized? body part (priority of the organism), anatomy of the target, protection, regeneration, motivation, ... Substantial damage limitation is to be expected through armor. If this is insufficient, the damage is again close to 100%. depending on the target's anatomy, this could mean a reload.

Depending on the impact and power of the projectile, this can either be just a prick or a part of the body is missing. a mechanic known from earlier fallout parts. if no part of the body is missing, even the prick will bleed, depending on the size of the wound canal, more or less blood will flow. less blood means less blood sugar. hypoglycaemia means black screen. blackscreen means fainting. no sight means no game. other side effects that can play a role: less movement speed, less accuracy, holding breath impossible, instand AP drain, and so on ...

> **Blood loss** is a mechanic that has serious consequences and is extremely interesting for a "survival game"! prevention and care alone offer a large amount of leeway.

### Bullet Sponge
> _See: https://github.com/Wastheland/Horizon/wiki/Combat#everything-hurts_

Vanilla Fallout 4 in the normal difficulty was very authentic as to the damage of certain, not to say all, firearms and so on. this is something that Horizon should also reinstate. besides all the great mechanics, the mod is very bullet spongy. so please change that so that at least there is an option to enable during installation. 1 to 3 projectiles next to what I mentioned above. only one projectile depending on the part of the body. depending on the level of protection, there can be several dozen. depending on the enemy, hundreds. and other technologies must be used (rocket launchers, mines, combat pets). a deathclaw cant be killed easily even with high powered rifles. then you have to aim correctly. What's the point of the belly button if the creature's two eyes are rendered unusable? A hit in the eye was possible in older parts of fallout. think about it!

Kill speed should look like that:

<a href="https://youtu.be/mZNGtmMxZhA?t=3177"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mZNGtmMxZhA/0.jpg" height="250">

* for body hits 2 or 3 hits thats it ...
* gore effect should be based on damage (type, caliber)

### The Magic of Adhesive
> Coat yourself in glue and let the magic of adhesive overwhelm your presence 😇

`Wound healing is weird.. whether you ram oversized stimpaks into your groin or embalm your whole body with bandages. just think logically about the whole thing.` how bad is the blood loss? is a bandage enough? Yes? no? if not? what do you need then? a clamp? a belt? ok for the thigh. what if the stomach was hit? internal bleeding, yes, no? if so, then sh!t.

basically that's enough to get started. so what if each projectile can already cause great damage (blood loss). of course you need adequate armor. which can be a hindrance depending on the technology. if that annoys you, it is better not to get hit and disappear in the shadow. BUT although the armor keeps the projectile away where is the kinetic energy going? in the armor, behind the armor, on the body so yes damage, health loss, blunt damage. something harder in case of high powered rifles: POWER ARMOR.

`protection for certain projectiles should only be possible through power armor. especially high powered rifles. that's the damn reason for this technology. why is anyone else running around in this thing?`

so i would like to see a little authenticity and not these pony farm mechanics. 1 hit and death, cirppled, severe blood loss, less accuracy, and so on (as already mentioned above and visible in the navigation on the right).

_at this point I advise everyone to play without armor at all. that really puts you in a good mood and shows you completely new paths. this is the way _Horizon_ can one take a harder way of playing. similar to desolation mode where everything is reduced. if everything goes quickly, you simply avoid certain encounters for the time being, otherwise they mean the end. you come back later when the technology is sufficient._

### Building Settlements till there is no tomorrow ..
> _See: https://github.com/Wastheland/Horizon/wiki/Settlements_

`Building settlements and using production takes an eternity to say the least. in that time i played the game 10 times and earned a lot more loot than the whole production would have ever done.`

the production times (real time) are simply too long. I can understand that you want to put a stop to one or the other but 15, 30, 90 minutes? why there is no modifier based on technology and so on? no matter how everything is produced, nobody cares. the commonwealth gives a sh!t!

pump a few points into the defense of your settlement and hardly ever expect attacks. _seriously: everyone sees the smoke from the production for miles and knows that the party is going on there_. why do certain buildings not have an attack rating to increase this? why are attacks on those settlements not increasing?

`even if the settlement is heavily protected. what does the average horizon player do? sneak, sniper, boom headshot. nobody cares you can take a whole series of projectiles, if necessary hammer a couple of stimpaks into your belly and play rambo all day long.`

`💡 so if you want to put a stop to it, start with the damage, adjust the armor and the production. increase attacks on the settlement CLEARLY and generally the player threat because this increases due to increased production in the settlement.`

### AI is waiting tooooo long ..
NPCs should attack the buildings and production facilities depending on the attack rating. depending on the value of the resources that are produced there. For example, if the player likes to play aggressively, he could increase the production rate but pay the price. that the attack rate increases significantly. In this case there are very interesting attacks and you should stay close to the settlement. that would unlock a whole series of dynamic and minimize the time grinder actions.

> _See: https://github.com/Wastheland/Horizon/wiki/Enemies_

The AI and NPCs in general is a big disappointment. simply stripped without great variance, even if horizon is already taking a strong countermeasure here. it still not finished. the main impact could be the increase in the field of vision. if NPCs could see as far as the player, there would be a lot more challenges. if the NPCs are equipped with precision rifles.. so why is the AI kept so small with handicaps. corvega a is a very good example that the AI gives a sh!t. _you can see so far from there you would notice almost everything.._

### Summary
_This game is realesed as unfinished business `finish it ZAW` you're doing a great job already. **Why making so many difficulties?** its a mod not FO5. why not simply release this mod in desolation mode only? together with a 1:1 damage ratio of course with an armor, damage and AI overhaul. in this case you would make sure everyone talking about the same issue(s). with various difficulties you and everyone else is doomed to run into confusion. `although i can understand your attitude if you say everyone should have the opportunity to play the game as they want.`_
